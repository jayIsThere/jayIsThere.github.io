Before we start studying, let us keep in mind Google Java Style Guide. (important parts only)

 1. Tab characters are not used for indentation.
 2. Exactly one black line separates each section that is present.
 3. No line break before the opening brace.
 4. Line break after the opening brace.
 5. Line break before the closing brace.
 6. Line break after the closing brace.
 7. The indent increases by two spaces.
 8. Java code has a column limit of 100 characters.
and so on...

In the first lesson, we've learnt how to print string words out in Java.

```java
package myfirstclass;

/**
 * Prints a message to the screen.
 */
public class FirstClass {
  /**
   * Prints a message to a screen.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Nun geht's los.");
  }
}
```
